Package Title: purrr

Location: CRAN

Vignette(s): The package does have a formal vignette. It covers topics such as what tools it draws inspiration from as well as the goals of the purrr package.

Application(s): Yes, @joshmccrain on twitter posted an introduction and application of the package showing its basic functions and how to create models and visualizations with purrr. In his demonstration he created a list of ggplot objects to apply to a map, which gives you the ability to call them separately.

Review: I don’t have too much experience with purrr, but from what I’ve used it for and read about it online I find it really interesting. The package is meant to provide a set of functions that can make your coding more efficient for working with functions and vectors in R. For example the map function completes the same tasks as a for loop but with different coding, like the different R apply functions. Though purrr functions are named more consistently than apply functions and can make code more readable. I like the consistency of this package, lambda functions are needed as much so it makes navigating data manipulation easier and more readable/reproducible for me. While I’m still learning all of the possibilities of the package, I do not find it hard to figure out, there is very good documentation available for it and lots of online resources for different applications of the function.  I don’t necessarily have any complaints for the package, as it applications for what I have used are simple. I would recommend the purrr package to those who do not like the application of the apply function family in R, as purrr can be easier to read and use, though if you are already used to the apply functions, purrr may not be worth learning.
